Questions / Tasks

5.1. Can you explain the copy (cp ../temp-* .) command used above? 

#The command copies all files starting with temp- from the parent folder (one level up) into current folder.

5.2. Can you explain why, in this case, we did not have to do git init?

#Because in this exercise, we cloned an existing repository from GitHub using git clone.

5.3. Can you commit the files copied? What do you need to do? Execute the commands that are needed.

#Yes. Once Iâ€™ve copied the files into my repository, I have to stage and commit. Following this step-by-step:

$ git status

$ git add .

$ git commit -m "Add temp files to project"

To verify that the files are successfully committed:

$ git status

And should appear:

On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
nothing to commit, working tree clean
